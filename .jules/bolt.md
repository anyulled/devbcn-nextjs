## 2026-02-01 - Hidden CSS Images

**Learning:** Found critical hero images being loaded via CSS `background-image` in React components, bypassing Next.js image optimization.
**Action:** grep for `style={{.*backgroundImage.*url` or `url(` in components to find hidden unoptimized images.

## 2026-02-01 - Package Lock Noise

**Learning:** `package-lock.json` generated massive diffs (removing dev dependencies like `webpack`) during `npm install`. This indicates environment mismatch.
**Action:** When working on small optimizations, always verify `package-lock.json` diffs and revert them if they include unrelated changes, to avoid breaking the build.

## 2026-02-01 - Client-Side Fetching Anti-Pattern in App Router

**Learning:** Found `useEffect` fetching static content (Speakers) in a Client Component (`Section5`) on the homepage. This caused unnecessary layout shifts and delayed LCP.
**Action:** Move data fetching to the parent Server Component (`page.tsx`) and pass data as props. This leverages ISR caching and eliminates client-side waterfall.

## 2026-03-18 - Immutability constraints over performance in grouping loops

**Learning:** When attempting to optimize an O(N^2) array spread operation (`[...existing, talk]`) inside a grouping loop in `groupTalksByTrack`, the purely functional/immutable constraint specified by the team (and the lack of `Map.groupBy` support in Node 20.x Jest environments) means that we must fall back to immutable reductions.
**Action:** When constraints require strict immutability without mutation of objects, use `reduce` with object and array spreads (e.g., `{ ...acc, [key]: [...(acc[key] || []), item] }`) even if it introduces O(N^2) overhead for large arrays. Avoid using `push()` or modifying accumulators directly. Always run Prettier/formatting checks before merge to resolve CI failures.

## 2026-03-22 - generateStaticParams Optimization

**Learning:** When `generateStaticParams` uses a sequential `for...of` loop to fetch data for multiple years (N+1 query pattern), it increases build time unnecessarily since the fetches are independent and can be run concurrently.
**Action:** Replace `for...of` loops in `generateStaticParams` and `sitemap.ts` with `await Promise.all(years.map(async (year) => { ... }))` to fetch data and build parameter lists in parallel, improving build-time efficiency.
