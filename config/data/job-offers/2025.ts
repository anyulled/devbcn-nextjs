Do you love web development and innovation?

Do you feel comfortable both creating beautiful front-end UX components and developing efficient algorithms on the back-end side?

Do you want the features you develop to be used by thousands of the biggest companies around the world?

Do you want to work in a high-scale SaaS product (+1300 AWS instances, +2.1Gbps incoming traffic)?

Do you thrive for improving the quality bar of the teams you work with?

Are you a proactive team-player willing to join an outstanding work environment?

We are looking for outstanding senior frontend developers who don't stick too much to a single library/framework but rather have a broad and deep understanding of any reactive JavaScript framework, JavaScript in general, HTML, CSS/SCSS and web development in general.

If you feel equally comfortable working with React, Angular, Vue or some other reactive FE framework as you are with vanilla JS and Web Components, and you don't mind writing some back-end code from time to time, we want you in our team.`,
